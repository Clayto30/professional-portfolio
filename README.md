## Description 
​
I'm Clayton Goff and this web page is designed to give me some experience using html and advanced CSS while meeting the criteria for UCB Bootcamp Challenge #2. This also serves to build my professional portfolio toward the goal of a career in web development.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
​
If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage 
​
When you load my portfolio page, you should find that it loads without problems. First, you'll notice a picture of me! Please use the navigation links to travel to the various sections inlcuding one about, another featuring images that link to my projects, and my contact information.

I used two examples from class of projects I've worked on as a lesson and as a challenge. The first is the lesson, Run Buddy landing page. I built this page step by step with detailed instruction in the course material. The second is a page that I was tasked with scouting code, fixing links, and improving code. The final is a website that I have not contributed dev work to, but I am currently employed there in a customer support role. I thought it would be useful to add some content to the page.

​I did not reach a completely satisfactory layout. I wish I could improve the images that link to projects and their titles. I wish I could improve the section title for contact me. Further work is required, but time does not allow! I could also scout and improve the code greatly, given time.

For responsiveness, I add a feature that made the text not get too small on smaller screen resolutions. Please take a look at this screenshot which demonstrates this responsiveness:

## Credits
​
Run Buddy was created with the instruction of UCBerkeley Extension's private course modules.

The Horiseon landing page is also provided with instructions for completion from the same program as above.
